**ayapingping-sh** is the main shell script (`/bin/sh`) for ayapingping's generator, which follows **POSIX** standards to ensure 
it can run effectively on any platform, operating system, or programming language shell session. This script is currently 
used by every ayapingping variant and will be used in the next variant. Because the main generator is written in shell 
script, adapting the next ayapingping variant to a new or different programming language should be straightforward.

## Variants

Currently, ayapingping has the following variants:

- Golang: [ayapingping-go](https://github.com/dalikewara/ayapingping-go)
- Python: [ayapingping-py](https://github.com/dalikewara/ayapingping-py)
- TypeScript: [ayapingping-ts](https://github.com/dalikewara/ayapingping-ts)

## Getting Started

There's no need to get started here. To see how the generator works, just take a look at the `main.sh` file.
